Education
•	Harvard
o	After three semesters here at Harvard, I’m looking to apply my extensive experience in web dev at Snapchat!
o	I’ve been majoring in Computer Science on the Mind/Brain/Behavior track, which is a fancy way of saying “specializing in Machine Learning”.
o	In the first CS class I took here at Harvard, I scored in the top 10 out of 800 students. The next year, I was invited to return as a teaching fellow, which was a great experience.
o	I’ve also taken courses in advanced algorithms, systems, theory of computation, machine learning, and data visualization on the web.
o	Outside of computer science, I’ve taken courses in music, neuroscience, and Russian! Здравствуйте! Меня зовут Паша. 
•	New England Conservatory
o	I’m also a concert pianist, and I’m enrolled in a dual degree program with the New England Conservatory of Music in Downtown Boston.
o	A year after graduating from Harvard I’ll receive a master’s degree in piano performance from NEC. 
o	Piano video
o	When I return to Harvard, I’ll be able to return to the dual-degree program where I left off.
Experience
•	Gifs.com
o	In 2015, I dropped out of Harvard to become a founding team member of Gifs.com, the world’s fastest and fullest-featured animated GIF creator!
o	Gifs has been funded by a ton of investors, including Peter Thiel, Biz Stone, and Snapchat’s great friend, Binary Capital!
o	While I lived in San Francisco, I was the lead dev for a month and a half and helped scale up to tens of millions of monthly pageviews.
o	I ended up returning to school, but Gifs is still growing and I’d love to get some of that excitement back as part of Snapchat!
•	Skindeep
o	I attended HackTech, Caltech’s annual hackathon, in 2016, and won best ML hack for my project, Skindeep! It detects skin cancer using just your phone camera. 
o	I was in charge of both feature engineering for detecting cancer in images, and also developing the responsive webapp for our site in react and node.
•	Microsoft
o	I’ve been working in Microsoft’s office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, working on a node.js chatbot.
o	I’ve been working full-stack, working on everything from the super-slick landing page to API wrappers for Slack to writing Mocha-Chai-Sinon tests for database interfaces.
o	The experience I’ve gained has been invaluable and puts me on par or even gives me an edge on college graduates.
•	CoxLab
o	While in school, I did computational neuroscience and machine learning research in professor David Cox’s lab at Harvard.
o	I worked on a way to improve computer vision using eye-tracking data of human subjects and a way to visualize this data on the web.
•	Teaching Fellow for CS50
o	As a freshman, I took Computer Science 50 and scored in the top 10 out of its 800 students.
o	My professor reached out to me personally to congratulate me and ask me to be a teaching fellow for the course.
o	I taught a section of 12 students in Fall 2015 and helped countless students at Office Hours, especially with the web-related problem sets.
o	I really enjoyed the experience of teaching students anywhere from freshmen to 35-year-old business school students, and received a 4.4/5 student evaluation! 
Skills
•	Web Dev
o	I love web dev. I grew up with the internet and it’s the first thing I learned how to program.
o	I built my first website when I was 8, back when creating rounded corners required using images and tables! 
o	Nowadays I’m obsessed with the latest technologies: I love ES6, HTML5, React, Typescript, Node, SASS, d3.js—you name it.
o	Having worked a ton on Gifs.com’s web player, I’d say my specialty is actually building slick video experiences on the web.
o	 I’m proficient in node.js and built a dozen websites using it, but I know my way around Laravel PHP and I’m pretty good with Elasticsearch.
•	Systems and Machine Learning
o	I’ve made myself home here in zsh, and I’m super comfortable with the Unix command line. I’ve used Java for seven years and Python for a little less.
